# Biography
Dr. Joyce Ovalle (_pronounced oh-VAH-yeh_) is a postdoctoral fellow with [Planet Texas 2050](https://planettexas2050.utexas.edu/) at The University of Texas at Austin, where she earned her Ph.D. in Public Policy from the LBJ School of Public Affairs. Her research examines civil society institutions, with a focus on their contributions to public policy and environmental quality.

Her dissertation, *Environmental Nonprofits in U.S. Climate Governance: Understanding Resources, Rhetoric, and Heterogeneity*, is a three-study project that employs network analysis, regression modeling, and large-scale text analysis to analyze the funding patterns, messaging strategies, and organizational diversity that shape the sector’s role in climate governance. Her work analyzes how these organizations organize decision-making, frame climate priorities, and mobilize resources across diverse geographic contexts in the United States.

Dr. Ovalle’s research has been published in *Nonprofit Policy Forum*, *PLOS ONE*, and the *Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology*. Her research, teaching, and professional perspective are informed by prior roles at the Urban Institute’s Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy and the U.S. Department of Energy.

A proud first-generation graduate of Texas public schools, Dr. Ovalle is a long-distance running enthusiast and art appreciator.
