# Teaching

Dr. Ovalle is prepared to teach introductory and advanced seminars in public policy and administration, nonprofit/NGO management, mixed-methods research, and environmental policy dynamics. At the heart of Dr. Ovalle’s teaching philosophy is a simple premise: each student brings valuable experience and perspective that strengthens everyone’s learning. Therefore, her teaching is not only about delivering content; it is about building curiosity, reflection, and purpose. She designs courses that invite thoughtful questions and connect class topics to real issues in public life.

## Selected Student Feedback
*From Individual Teaching Assistant Reports:*

- “Joyce was excellent and made herself super available for any questions. She really enlightened me on how to build a theoretical framework, and that helped to guide our project!”
