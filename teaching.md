Dr. Ovalle is prepared to teach introductory and advanced seminars in public policy and administration, nonprofit and NGO management, mixed-methods research, and environmental policy dynamics. Her teaching philosophy rests on a simple premise: the professor’s perspective is one among many, and each student brings experiences and insights that enrich the classroom. She aims to cultivate curiosity, reflection, and a sense of purpose, designing courses that invite thoughtful questions and connect class topics to pressing issues in public life.
